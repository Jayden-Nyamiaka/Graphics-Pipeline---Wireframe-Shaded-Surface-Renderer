Compile and Execute Instructions:
    1) Running "make all" compiles everything the code needs to run.
    2) Run "make run" to generate 800 by 800 ppm images for all scene description files in data.
        - Appropriate ppm files are created within the data folder.
        - The ppm images can also print to Standard Out via Wireframe::output(true) in wireframe.cpp (doesn't print by default).
        - Rendering progress is printed via cerr (can be turned off via Wirefame::plot(false) in wireframe.cpp).
    3) The ppm3-to-png.py file from the last project is still there.
        - More info can be found in the ppm3-to-png.py file.
        - Run "make generate_pngs" to produce pngs from any generated ppms.
        - Conversion sometimes may not work if the supplied image is too big.
    4) Run "make clean" to delete any generated files.
